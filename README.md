# Random Number Generator

 Function randomIn7 generates integers between 1 and 7 (evenly distributed) using function randomIn5() that returns integers between 
 1 and 5 (evenly distributed). To display the distribution, an Array with 7 fields was created and the number at the index of the generated
 number is being incremented. The distribution can be observed in the console.
